#  Cybersecurity Home Lab

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Home Lab! This project provides a hands-on environment using **Kali Linux** and vulnerable VMs like **Metasploitable 2** to practice network scanning, exploitation, and reporting.

## Lab Structure
- Kali Linux: Attacker machine
- Metasploitable 2: Vulnerable target

## System Requirements
- RAM: 8–16 GB
- Disk: 100–200 GB
- CPU: 4–6 cores

## Tools
- Nmap
- Metasploit
- Searchsploit
## Structure
  -vsftpd 2.3.4 Backdoor Exploit**
  - Performed service enumeration with Nmap.
  - Identified vulnerable vsftpd 2.3.4 service on port 21.
  - Used Metasploit and netcat to exploit the backdoor and gain root shell access.
